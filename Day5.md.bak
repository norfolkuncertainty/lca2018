# Day 5

## Keynote: Containers aka crazy user space fun - Jess Frazelle

The most technical keynote I have ever seen at LCA.

Jess's enthusiasm and technical abilities are awesome.

She has me wanting to run my desktop on containers

Intel clear containers / katacontainers are fast booting vms that sound very interesting

Jess's container website that helps you test container capabilities

http://contained.af

She switched all of her containers from docker to runc

riddler is a program that will convert docker -> open container forman (runc)

runc doesnt have a build in network bridge like docker

netns - runc network hook

metaparticle.io

The goals of the Metaparticle project are to democratize the development of distributed systems. Metaparticle achieves this by providing simple, but powerful building blocks, built on top of containers and Kubernetes

## Self-Documenting Coders: Writing Workshop for Devs - Heidi Waterhouse

Liner documents

* old school

task based writing 

* test driven documentation

object oriented writing

* had to be compiled
* lots of regex

guerrilla writing

* stack overflow, youtube etc

search first writing

* every page is page one

The 5 W's

* Who am i writing for
* what do they need to know
* how can i find that out
* how can i explain it
* who can help me
* who can test

* short clear sentences
* graphics for concepts
* avoid screen shots
* use style guide and linters for English
* https://github.com/btford/write-good
* https://github.com/wooorm/alex
* https://github.com/amperser/proselint
* remember accessibility

Use templates 

[madlibs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs)

semantic tagging allows reuse

metadata around text

Sort topics into buckets

Give people a next step

provide links to related info on your page

Age your CSS so its 10% paler every month. Within a year you'll have white on white and be forced to re-review it for relevance and quality.

Trick developers into contributing to doco by writing something you know is incorrect and asking for their feedback

Documentation hack days

Delete

* old stuff
* wrong stuff - wrong stuff hides right stuff
* anything dangerous
* anything that hasn't been used/updated in x years

Documentation must be

* true
* timely
* testable
* tuned
 
“Anybody reading documentation is already lost or pissed off. Just give them what they want and then ask yourself ‘what is driving them to be here’”

Things to think about when documenting

* what other stuff affects this
* what are the optional settings
* what are the related things

Best:

* code you can run in the docs

Second:

* Copy paste code

Worst:

* Retyping code

Error messages should include
* unique identifier
* what caused the error
* mitigation instructions
* a link to report

Some well written doco to reference:

* Redhat gluster doco
* gnome documentation tool - malard
* readthedocs.io

[A session that was run by Heidi](https://opensource.com/article/17/11/kanban-boards-card-sorting)

docs as code, code as docs

## Remote Work: My first decade working from the far end of the earth - John Dalton

Some challenges with working from home

### Dicipline

* Ticket system to show progress
* Wikipedia time management

### Isolation

* Keep in contact with local tech
* meet-ups are a good way to keep in the loop
* co working with other remote workers

### Setting boundaries

* easy to work ALL the time
* dedicated work space

### Internet access

* Multiple providers fixed + mobile

### Communication

* physical queues missed
* Impromptu conversations don't happen over lunch/water cooler
* assumed knowledge is dangerous
* When giving instructions to remote workers, its hard to find a medium between condescending and bamboozling
* potential cultural differences
* timezone issues can result in async communication

* go home at the end of the day
* make time for networking
