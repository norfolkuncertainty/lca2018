# Day 5
## Keynote: Containers aka crazy user space fun - Jess Frazelle
The most technical keynote I have ever seen at LCA.
Jess's enthusiasm and technical abilities are awesome.
She has me wanting to run my desktop on containers

intel clear containers / katacontainers are fast booting vms that sound very interesting

Jess's container website that helps you test container capabilities
http://contained.af

She switched all of her containers from docker to runc
riddler is a program that will convert docker -> open container forman (runc)
runc doesnt have a build in network bridge like docker
netns - runc network hook

metaparticle.io
The goals of the Metaparticle project are to democratize the development of distributed systems. Metaparticle achieves this by providing simple, but powerful building blocks, built on top of containers and Kubernetes

Age your CSS so its 10% paler every month. Within a year you'll have white on white and be forced to re-review it for relevance and quality.

Trick developers into contributing to doco by writing something you know is incorrect and asking for their feedback

Documentation hack days

Delete

 wrong stuff - wrong stuff hides right stuff

Book - the sweedish art of death cleaning

Documentation must be
 true
 timely
 testable
 tuned
 
“Anybody reading documentation is already lost or pissed off. Just give them what they want and then ask yourself ‘what is driving them to be here’”

Things to think about when documenting
what other stuff affects this
what are the optional settings
what are the related things

Best:
code you can run in the docs
Second:
Copy paste code
Worst:
Retyping code

Error messages should include
 - unique identifier
 - what caused the error
 - mitigation instructions
 - a link to report

Some well written doco to reference:
Redhat gluster doco
gnome documnetation tool - malard
readthedocs.io

A session that was run by Heidi

docs as code, code as docs

Inpromptue conversations dont happen over lunch/water cooler
assumed knowledge is dangerous
When giving instructions to remote workers, its hard to find a medium between condesending and bamboozling
