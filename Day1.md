# Love thy future self: making your systems ops-friendly - Matt Palmer

Metrics are key

Add guages/metrics to everything so you can see what "magic" is happening
Instrumentation: The first four things to measure
Incoming requetss
count the number/type
how many responses success/error
Measure timings success/error
How many you arehandling right now

Whats does it mean?
Drop in requests recieved
- upstream issues
Increase request rate
- Getting hammered - why?

Responses sent
-Increase error rate - issue here, or downstream
Increase in time - issue here or downstream

Inprogress
Increase  - weird
Inprogressdoesnt match recieved vs responses

outgoing requests
Requests sent/recieved success/error
How long to get response error/success
Outstanding requets

Drop in incoming/outgoing - we are not making the requests

responses recieved
error rate - downstream
time taken increase - Downstream has slowed down

Where ^

Why - Logs
Three log priorities that really matter
ERROR
INFO
DEBUG

Error
Full stacktrace on Errors
Add info, dont replace
Capture all relevant variables, envrionment etc
Stuctured log data, not huge lines of txt

INFO
Startup

DEBUG
printf debugging
Tag with module and method
Create uniq id for each top level request
Late-bind the log data
Allow selective activation

Make it Visibility
Instrument it
Logerrors all the time
Allow runtime collection of debug logs
